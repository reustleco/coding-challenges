## Frontend Project

The task is to create a simple frontend-only clone of [https://humans.io](https://humans.io) using React and Redux. This is a little project built by our CEO a few years ago. The basic functionality is to add/edit/delete humans. You can use a UI library like Bootstrap or Semantic UI to make it look nice.

You do **NOT** need to implement the following:

- A backend
- A login / accounts system
- Calendar / reminder feature
- Auto save feature (you can add a save button instead)
- The exact design (design and user experience should be similar, though)
- A search box
- Settings page

The final result should be a simple, single-page app where you can add/edit/delete humans.

**Bonus Points**

- Try implementing the search box
- Save humans in localstorage to show them between page refreshes


### Guidelines

Create a new repo under your account and use git to log your work.

When you are finished, please share the repo with us. Also, please enable "github pages" on the repository, that way you can run the project at `http://your-username.github.io/project-name`

If there's something we should clarify or help with, please don't hesitate to ask.

Please use inline comments wherever you see fit to explain why you made certain coding decisions.
